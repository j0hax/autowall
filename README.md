# autowall
A simple shell script that will download and set a black-and-white wallpaper
## Installation
Recommended: `curl -sL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j0hax/autowall/master/autowall.sh' | sh`

Or, download the script yourself and run `chmod +x autowall.sh`, then run it with `./autowall.sh`.
## Support
At the moment the script is MacOS only.

*Linux support may come as volunteers contribute. (`feh` anyone?)*
